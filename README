RadioDNS client library
=======================

This is a simple client library for RadioDNS.

The public interface is in libradiodns.h. Much of it should be fairly
self-explanatory: you create a context using one of the radiodns_create()
family of functions, which either uses the specified domain name (in
the case of radiodns_create() itself) or constructs one based on
supplied parameters (in the case of the other functions in the family).

One a context has been created, you can use radiodns_resolve_target() to
find the target domain name beneath which SRV records will be looked for.

At any point you can call radiodns_domain() or radiodns_target() to query
the current (initial) domain name or target domain name. If
radiodns_resolve_target() has yet to be called or failed catastrophically,
radiodns_target() will return NULL.

Note that everything is synchronous: anything with 'resolve' in the name
will perform one or more DNS queries and block until complete. Usual
cautions regarding UI threads and networking apply.

Once you're finished with a context, you should use radiodns_destroy()
to free up the resources associated with it.

Accompanying the library is a command-line utility, currently named
'radiodns' which allows testing. Run the utility without any parameters
for a usage summary. Any numerical values used as parameters can be
specified in decimal as-is, in hexadecimal with a '0x' prefix, or octal
with a '0' prefix.

For example, Capital FM in London:

$ ./radiodns fm 9580 0xc586 0xce1
Domain: 09580.c586.ce1.fm.radiodns.org
Target: rnds.musicradio.com

Or BBC One in Bristol:

$ ./radiodns dvb 0x233a 0x1041 0x10bf 0x3098
Domain: 3098.10bf.1041.233a.dvb.tvdns.net
Target: west.bbc.srv.tvdns.net

At the moment, neither the library nor the command-line tool performs any
queries for SRV records -- this is next on the to-do list.
