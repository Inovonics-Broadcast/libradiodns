.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(T<\fBradiodns_create\fR\*(T> family of functions create
a new RadioDNS context which can be used as a handle for performing
application discovery.
.PP
The \*(T<\fBradiodns_create\fR\*(T> function in particular
creates a context using the specified DNS domain name,
\*(T<dnsdomain\*(T>. This is in contrast to the other
functions in the family, such as
\*(T<\fBradiodns_create_amss\fR\*(T>, which use the supplied
parameters to \fIgenerate\fR a domain name.
.PP
Once a context has been created, its target domain name can be
discovered using \*(T<\fBradiodns_resolve_target\fR\*(T>. The
target domain name is the fully-qualified domain name which, in
the event of \*(T<dnsdomain\*(T> (or its generated
equivalent) being a CNAME or
DNAME, is ultimately referred to, accounting
for chains of CNAME records.
.PP
For example, if \*(T<\fBradiodns_create\fR\*(T> was called
with a \*(T<dnsdomain\*(T> value of
\*(T<foo.example.com\*(T>, and
\*(T<foo.example.com\*(T> was a CNAME
referring to \*(T<bar.example.org\*(T>, and this was not
itself a CNAME or DNAME,
then the target domain name for the context would be
\*(T<bar.example.org\*(T>.
.PP
Application discovery can be performed on a context using
\*(T<\fBradiodns_resolve_app\fR\*(T>. This function queries
DNS for specifically-named records which are children of the
target associated with the context. Further details are included
in the description of the \*(T<\fBradiodns_resolve_app\fR\*(T>
function itself.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, \*(T<\fBradiodns_resolve_app\fR\*(T> returns an
initialized context pointer. On failure, \*(T<NULL\*(T> is
returned and \*(T<errno\*(T> is set appropriately. The returned
context should be freed once no longer needed with
\*(T<\fBradiodns_destroy\fR\*(T>.
